# Simple PHP Framework

This is a Laravel-inspired simple custom MVC-based PHP framework.

## How to use

Clone repository and run `npm install` in root directory.

Routes are defined in `routes/web.php`.

Assets can be compiled with Laravel Mix by running npm scripts: `dev`, `watch` or `prod`. Assets use TypeScript and SCSS and are located in `resources/ts` and `resources/scss`.

Views are defined in `resources/views`. Both HTML and PHP views are supported. Views can also be in sudirectories.
